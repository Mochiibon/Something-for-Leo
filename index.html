    <h1>A Message for Leo ðŸ’Œ</h1>
    <p>Hi Leo,</p>
    <p>Iâ€™ve been holding onto this for a while, and I think itâ€™s time to let it out. Iâ€™ve liked you since last year, ever since someone pointed out how we had a lot of similarities. That thought stayed with me, and it made me more curious about you.</p>
    <p>Since then, Iâ€™ve admired so much about you. Youâ€™re incredibly talented, whether itâ€™s in arts, academics, or just the way you approach everything with so much confidence and skill.</p>
    <p>I also want to apologize if Iâ€™ve ever made you uncomfortable when Iâ€™m around. That was never my intention. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel because itâ€™s been on my mind for a long time.</p>
    <p>No matter what your response is, I really respect you. I think youâ€™re an incredible person.</p>
    <button onclick="alert('Leo, thank you for reading this!')">Click Me</button>
</body>
